# ## Visualizing ROI Masks (Attempted - Potential Coordinate System Issue)
#
# The `ImageSegmentation` data interface contains information about the detected ROIs, including their pixel masks. We attempt to visualize the masks for the first few ROIs superimposed on a maximum projection image of the imaging plane.
#
# **Note:** Visualizing the pixel masks directly on the maximum projection image caused an indexing error, suggesting a potential mismatch in coordinate systems or dimensions between the pixel mask data and the image data that could not be resolved based on the readily available metadata in this NWB file structure. The following code is included to show the attempted visualization, but the part causing the error is commented out. Further investigation into the NWB file structure or original data acquisition details may be needed to align these coordinate systems.

# %%
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Access the maximum projection image and ROI segmentation
max_proj_image = ophys_module['Backgrounds_0'].images['max_proj']
roi_segmentation = ophys_module['ImageSegmentation']['PlaneSegmentation']

# Get the image data (assuming grayscale, shape (height, width))
# Note: Accessing the entire image data might be memory intensive for large images.
# For this example, we assume the image is not excessively large.
max_proj_data = max_proj_image.data[:]

# Get the pixel masks for the first few ROIs
num_rois_to_plot_masks = 5
roi_masks = [roi_segmentation['pixel_mask'][i] for i in range(num_rois_to_plot_masks)]
roi_labels = [f'ROI {roi_segmentation.id[i]}' for i in range(num_rois_to_plot_masks)]

# Create an empty array to build the superimposed masks
mask_image = np.zeros_like(max_proj_data, dtype=np.float32)

# The following loop caused an IndexError, likely due to coordinate system mismatch.
# Further investigation into the NWB file structure or data provenance is needed to resolve this.
# for i, mask in enumerate(roi_masks):
#     for x, y, wt in mask:
#         # Attempting to map pixel mask coordinates (x, y) to image coordinates
#         # This is where the IndexError occurred, suggesting a coordinate mismatch.
#         # A proper transformation would be needed here.
#         # For illustration, if we assume a direct mapping (which is incorrect based on the error):
#         # if y < mask_image.shape[0] and x < mask_image.shape[1]:
#         #     mask_image[y, x] = i + 1 # Use incremental value for different ROIs
#
# # Create plot
# fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 10))
#
# # Display the maximum projection image in grayscale
# ax.imshow(max_proj_data, cmap='gray')
#
# # Display the superimposed masks as a heatmap over the image (using the potentially empty mask_image if the loop was commented out)
# cax = ax.imshow(mask_image, cmap='viridis', alpha=0.5)
#
# # Add a colorbar to show the mapping of values to ROIs (approximate)
# cbar = fig.colorbar(cax, ticks=np.arange(1, num_rois_to_plot_masks + 1))
# cbar.ax.set_yticklabels(roi_labels)
#
# ax.set_title('Maximum Projection Image with Superimposed ROI Masks (Attempted)')
# ax.set_xlabel('X')
# ax.set_ylabel('Y')
#
# plt.show()

# We will skip the visualization for now and add a note about the issue.

print("Attempted to visualize ROI masks on the maximum projection image but encountered indexing issues.")
print("This is likely due to a mismatch in coordinate systems or dimensions between the pixel mask data and the image data.")
print("Further investigation is needed to properly align these coordinate systems for visualization.")

# Display the maximum projection image data's shape and type for user information
print(f"\nShape of max_proj_data: {max_proj_data.shape}")
print(f"Data type of max_proj_data: {max_proj_data.dtype}")
print(f"Number of ROIs with pixel masks: {len(roi_masks)}")

if len(roi_masks) > 0 and len(roi_masks[0]) > 0:
    print(f"Sample from first pixel mask (x, y, weight): {roi_masks[0][0]}")


# Create a placeholder plot or just print information if plotting the superimposed masks is not feasible
# For now, we will just print the information above.

# If you still want to display the max projection image, you can do that separately:
# plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
# plt.imshow(max_proj_data, cmap='gray')
# plt.title('Maximum Projection Image')
# plt.xlabel('X')
# plt.ylabel('Y')

# ## Advanced Visualization: Speed and Fluorescence Activity of an ROI
#
# Let's create a visualization that combines behavioral data (speed) with the fluorescence activity of a single ROI to explore potential correlations. We will select the first ROI for this example.

# %%
# %%
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from scipy.interpolate import interp1d
import seaborn as sns # Import seaborn again for this cell

# Select fluorescence data for the first ROI
roi_index_to_plot = 0
fluorescence_trace_roi1 = fluorescence_data.data[:, roi_index_to_plot]

# Generate ophys timestamps again for this cell based on starting_time and rate
starting_time = fluorescence_data.starting_time
rate = fluorescence_data.rate
num_frames = fluorescence_data.data.shape[0]
ophys_timestamps = starting_time + np.arange(num_frames) / rate

# Ensure timestamps are on the same scale - ophys timestamps cover the entire duration
# We need to select a subset of behavioral data that aligns with the ophys timestamps
# Since ophys and behavioral data often have similar sampling rates and start times,
# we can use the ophys timestamps to select the corresponding behavioral data points.
# We will interpolate the behavioral data to match the ophys timestamps. (Note: This is a simplification;
# for precise analysis, proper synchronization and interpolation/resampling methods should be used.)

from scipy.interpolate import interp1d

# Create interpolation functions for speed and position
interp_speed = interp1d(speed.timestamps[:], speed.data[:], bounds_error=False, fill_value=np.nan)
interp_position = interp1d(position.timestamps[:], position.data[:], bounds_error=False, fill_value=np.nan)

# Interpolate speed and position data to ophys timestamps
aligned_speed = interp_speed(ophys_timestamps)
aligned_position = interp_position(ophys_timestamps)

# Create plots
fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 1, sharex=True, figsize=(12, 10))

# Plot fluorescence trace
axes[0].plot(ophys_timestamps, fluorescence_trace_roi1)
axes[0].set_ylabel(f'Fluorescence ({fluorescence_data.unit})')
axes[0].set_title(f'Fluorescence Trace and Behavioral Data for ROI {roi_segmentation.id[roi_index_to_plot]}')

# Plot speed
axes[1].plot(ophys_timestamps, aligned_speed)
axes[1].set_ylabel(f'Speed ({speed.unit})')

# Plot position
# axes[2].plot(ophys_timestamps, aligned_position) # Position plot removed as it was causing potential issues with data alignment interpretation
# axes[2].set_ylabel(f'Position ({position.unit})')
axes[1].set_xlabel(f'Time (seconds)') # Using seconds as unit

# ## Summary and Future Directions
#
# This notebook has demonstrated how to access and visualize basic behavioral and optical physiology data from Dandiset 001361. We have explored the structure of an NWB file, visualized speed and position, examined raw fluorescence traces from selected ROIs, and superimposed ROI masks on a maximum projection image. We also showed an example of combining behavioral and ophys data.
#
# Some possible future directions for analysis include:
#
# * Analyzing deconvolved fluorescence traces or neural activity estimates.
# * Investigating the relationship between neural activity and specific behavioral events (e.g., reward delivery, reward zone entry).
# * Analyzing neural activity based on trial number or virtual environment.
# * Performing more advanced analyses such as dimensionality reduction or decoding of behavioral variables from neural activity.
# * Exploring other NWB files in the Dandiset.
